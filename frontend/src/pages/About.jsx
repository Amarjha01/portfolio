            Hello, I'm Amar Kumar Jha, a dedicated and passionate tech
            enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
            Science and Engineering. My journey into the tech world began with a
            Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, which I completed from 2017 to
            2020. This foundational experience provided me with a strong
            analytical mindset and a problem-solving approach, which I have
            carried into my current studies and projects.

            After completing my diploma, I had the opportunity to work with
            Ashok Leyland, a prominent company in the mechanical sector. This
            experience was invaluable, as it allowed me to develop a practical
            understanding of engineering principles and project management.

            Transitioning into the field of Computer Science, I have recently
            acquired skills in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
            stack and DevOps. These new skills have enabled me to successfully
            create and deploy three significant projects, showcasing my ability
            to handle full-stack development and continuous
            integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for design,
            with basic proficiency in Figma and Canva. This allows me to create
            visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces for my projects.
